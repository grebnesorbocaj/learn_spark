# Learning Spark

Note: this repository (via `poetry new learn_spark`) comes with the file `README.rst`, using the restructured text format for documentation. Seems cool, maybe I'll learn it later (maybe not).

### Java

I don't remember how I installed this...(I also have java14 installed but 11 is my default)

```shell

```

### Poetry

```shell
$ poetry --version
Poetry version 1.1.4
```

### Python

Version of python via virtualenv... I think

```shell
$ python --version
Python 3.7.3
```

## Inspiration

Yaadi is a P.O.S. but I he told me to reference [his repo](https://github.com/Ydot19/taming-pyspark) for the same course and tbh it's kinda sexy. 

- Poetry for dependency management 
  - coming from development in a Conda environment this is a breath of fresh air
- Python Black for code formatting
  - looks like Yaadi doesn't even format with this often but it's nice and succint
- Python-Dotenv and Config.py
  - using a dotenv file is good practice something I should get used to
